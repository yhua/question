### Two Sum

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

`Input`: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9

`Output`: index1=1, index2=2


What's your solution ?

```sh
public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        
    }
}

```

### Jump Game

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

For example:

A = [2,3,1,1,4], return true.

A = [3,2,1,0,4], return false.


What's your solution:

```sh
public class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        
    }
}
 
```

### Decode String
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

`Examples`:

```sh
s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

```

What's your solution?

```sh
public class Solution {
    public String decodeString(String s) {
        
    }
}
```
